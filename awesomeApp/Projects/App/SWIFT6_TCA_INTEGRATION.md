## ⚠️ Critical Integration Guidelines

This project uses **Swift 6 Strict Concurrency** and **TCA 1.10+**.
Misuse of concurrency features can lead to build errors or runtime crashes.

### 1. AppState & Global State
- **Pattern**: `AppState` is a singleton (`shared`) but isolated to `@MainActor`.
- **Constraint**: You cannot access `AppState.shared` from background threads or non-isolated contexts.
- **Solution**: Always use `Dependency(\.appStateClient)` in Reducers.
  ```swift
  // ❌ BAD: Direct Access
  let version = AppState.shared.forceUpdateMinimumVersion

  // ✅ GOOD: Dependency Injection
  @Dependency(\.appStateClient) var appState
  let version = await appState.forceUpdateMinimumVersion()
  ```

### 2. Dependencies & Sendable
- **Rule**: All custom Dependencies must conform to `Sendable`.
- **Reason**: TCA Actions and State move across isolation boundaries.
- **Practice**:
  - Structs are implicitly Sendable if properties are Sendable.
  - Classes must be `final` and `Sendable` (atomic) or `Actor`.
  - Closures in Clients must be `@Sendable`.

### 3. Actors vs Reducers
- **Reducers** run on the Main Actor (mostly).
- **Services** (Actors) run in parallel.
- **Deadlock Risk**: Do not `await` main-actor bound code synchronously inside a purely synchronous reducer scope (TCA prevents this, but be careful with `Task.sleep` or blocking calls).

### 4. Codable Safety
- `Codable` types used in Keychain/UserDefaults are checked for Sendability.
- `KeychainStorage` is an `actor`, ensuring atomic writes. Do not fallback to raw `UserDefaults.standard` without locking if accessing from multiple threads.
